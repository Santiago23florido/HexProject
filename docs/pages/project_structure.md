# Project Structure

The repository is organized to separate public headers (`include/`), C++ implementation (`src/`), self‑play tooling (`selfplay/`), and Python scripts and trained models (`scripts/`). The self‑play module is split into `gnn/` (data generation pipeline) and `mlp/` (training and value model export).
